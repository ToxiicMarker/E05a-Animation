# E05a-Animation
This repository is about further movement with a mouse and movement with the keyboard. There is also a button included in main1.py. This was more exposure to classes and object oriented programming in general. 






We will begin to explore keyboard and mouse control in a Python Arcade program.

When you are done, main1.py should contain the code on [http://arcade.academy/examples/move_mouse.html#move-mouse](http://arcade.academy/examples/move_mouse.html#move-mouse). Play with the code until you feel like you understand what is going on. Comment any uncommented line; feel free to ask for help!

main2.py should contain the code on [http://arcade.academy/examples/move_keyboard.html#move-keyboard](http://arcade.academy/examples/move_keyboard.html#move-keyboard). Play with the code until you feel like you understand what is going on. Comment any uncommented line; feel free to ask for help!

For extra credit, you could create a main3.py that contains the code on [http://arcade.academy/examples/sprite_move_animation.html#sprite-move-animation](http://arcade.academy/examples/sprite_move_animation.html#sprite-move-animation). Download sprite assets for the player and coins and figure out how to make your character walk left and right.
